Excited to Share My Data Analysis Project: Online Book Sales ðŸš€

I analyzed an online book sales dataset using SQL and Excel to uncover customer behavior, sales performance, and revenue trends. Key highlights included:

âœ… Identifying top-selling genres & authors
âœ… Tracking repeat customer behavior
âœ… Analyzing revenue, seasonal peaks, and stock availability
âœ… Splitting categories into high vs. low margin
âœ… Designing an interactive Excel dashboard for KPIs

This project strengthened my data analysis, visualization, and BI skills, while showing how data-driven strategies fuel e-commerce growth. Excited to apply these skills to real-world datasets!
